      "story": "My journey started from a simple curiosity: understanding how our Universe works. From studying the chaotic regime of Saturn's rings to simulating particle collisions (M2 - ATLAS), I developed a rigorous work methodology: knowledge synthesis, then focus on a key point with concrete application of my skills, especially in data analysis. This approach extends to my personal projects, such as building this website. Here, you'll discover my journey as well as articles about my projects and hobbies !"
